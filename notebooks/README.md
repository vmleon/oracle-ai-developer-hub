# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to build AI applications, agents, and systems using Oracle AI Database and OCI services. These notebooks provide hands-on tutorials, examples, and best practices for developers working with Oracle's AI capabilities.

## Contents

The notebooks cover various aspects of AI development including:

- **Memory Engineering**: Building persistent memory systems for AI agents
- **Context Engineering**: Managing LLM context windows efficiently
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Building semantic search and RAG applications
- **AI Agents**: Creating intelligent agents that interact with Oracle AI Database
- **Vector Search**: Implementing vector similarity search and embeddings
- **Evaluation & Metrics**: Measuring and evaluating AI system performance
