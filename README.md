# Oracle AI Developer Hub

This repository contains technical resources to help AI Developers build AI applications, agents, and systems using Oracle AI Database and OCI services alongside other key components of the AI/Agent stack.

## What You'll Find

This repository is organized into several key areas:

### 📱 **Apps** (`/apps`)

Applications and reference implementations demonstrating how to build AI-powered solutions with Oracle technologies. These complete, working examples showcase end-to-end implementations of AI applications, agents, and systems that leverage Oracle AI Database and OCI services. Each application includes source code, deployment configurations, and documentation to help developers understand architectural patterns, integration approaches, and best practices for building production-grade AI solutions.

This project is open source. Please submit your contributions by forking this repository and submitting a pull request! Oracle appreciates any contributions that are made by the open-source community.

### Development Setup

Before contributing, please set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code is automatically formatted:

1. **Install pre-commit**:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. **Install additional dependencies** (optional, includes pre-commit and ruff):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks**:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Optional: Format existing code**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

The pre-commit hooks will automatically format your code using:

- **Ruff** for Python files (formatting and linting)
- **Prettier** for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, YAML, and Markdown files

For more detailed information, see [SETUP_PRE_COMMIT.md](./SETUP_PRE_COMMIT.md).
